# Week-8
ðŸ¦  COVID-19 Tracker for South Africa's Provinces
 Data Analysis Project Using Python

What This Project Does 
We are building a simple project to understand how COVID-19 spread in different provinces of South Africa. Weâ€™ll use a real dataset, clean it up, look at the numbers, and draw graphs to help understand:
-Total cases

-Total deaths

-Vaccinations

-Daily changes
#  Step 1: Get the Data
import pandas as pd


url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dsfsi/covid19za/master/data/covid19za_provincial_cumulative_timeline_confirmed.csv"

df = pd.read_csv(url)

print(df.head())

# out come 










import pandas as pd

# GitHub raw CSV URL from the DSFSI COVID-19 repo
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dsfsi/covid19za/master/data/covid19za_provincial_cumulative_timeline_confirmed.csv"

# Load the CSV file directly from the URL
df = pd.read_csv(url)

# See what the data looks like
print(df.head())
